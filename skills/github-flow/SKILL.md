# GitHub Flow

Convert plans, research, and implementation results into GitHub issues and PRs.

## Topics

| Topic | Description | Guide |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| auth-scope | gh CLI priority + account mapping + batch scope refresh + org-repo 404 checklist | [auth-scope.md](./auth-scope.md) |
| commit-message-discipline | Commit message authoring, message update on amend, PUBLIC repo English enforcement, git operation type continuity, verb selection (`.md` as source code) | [commit-message-discipline.md](./commit-message-discipline.md) |
| dependencies | Manage native Issue Relationships (blocked-by/blocking) via addBlockedBy/removeBlockedBy GraphQL mutations | [dependencies.md](./dependencies.md) |
| epic-bundle | Bundle deferred review findings across multiple PRs into one Epic tracking issue (checklist + native sub-issues + epic label) | [epic-bundle.md](./epic-bundle.md) |
| expand | Decide expand-vs-split when new findings emerge mid-work and update title/body | [expand.md](./expand.md) |
| identity-auth | Owner-based gh account mapping for commit author identity + gh auth scope refresh + GH_TOKEN env fallback for org repo 404 | [identity-auth.md](./identity-auth.md) |
| merge | CI success and AI review check then merge with commit cleanup, including pre-merge blockedBy verification | [merge.md](./merge.md) |
| plan-to-issue | Convert plan/research MD to GitHub issue body or comments | [plan-to-issue.md](./plan-to-issue.md) |
| pr | Create PR with structured body, test plan, and optional visual attachments | [pr.md](./pr.md) |
| push-guards | Branch-change ask + push rejection ask + force-push CI status check + main/master push restriction + shared-branch direct-push restriction | [push-guards.md](./push-guards.md) |
| register | Evaluate duplicates and decide registration strategy (new issue vs comment vs sub-issue) | [register.md](./register.md) |
| review | Review PR code and post structured review comments | [review.md](./review.md) |
| review-apply | Apply deferred [REVIEW_FEEDBACK] items from fix_plan to code, update PR Summary | [review-apply.md](./review-apply.md) |
| sanitize | HARD STOP scan for personal data before posting to PUBLIC repos | [sanitize.md](./sanitize.md) |
| upstream-issue | Register feature requests/bug reports on external open-source repos with duplicate check + draft + sanitize | [upstream-issue.md](./upstream-issue.md) |

## Topic Dependencies

```text
github-flow (issue/PR workflow)
  ├─→ plan-to-issue (issue body content)
  ├─→ epic-bundle (deferred findings across PRs → one Epic issue)
  │     ├─→ uses plan-to-issue (Epic body) + register (dup check) + dependencies (sub-issues)
  │     └─→ receives from: consolidate next step (auto-suggest when deferred findings accumulate)
  ├─→ register (evaluate duplicates and decide strategy)
  ├─→ pr (PR body content + visual attachments)
  ├─→ review (post structured review comments)
  ├─→ expand (mid-work scope expansion)
  ├─→ dependencies (Issue Relationships: blocked-by/blocking)
  │     └─→ used by merge step 5 (pre-merge blockedBy check)
  ├─→ merge (CI/Review/Test Plan/blockedBy verification → squash+merge)
  ├─→ review-apply (deferred [REVIEW_FEEDBACK] → code fix → Summary update)
  │     └─→ receives from: consolidate Step 7 (deferred registration)
  ├─→ sanitize (HARD STOP scan before posting to PUBLIC repos)
  └─→ upstream-issue (external repo feature request/bug report with duplicate check + draft + sanitize)
```

- **dependencies → merge**: dependencies adds blockedBy relationships. merge.md step 5 queries the same field to gate merge until predecessors are CLOSED
- **plan-to-issue → dependencies**: when a plan has frontmatter `chain:` declaring a sequential issue order, dependencies applies it to GitHub
- All topics → sanitize: any text published to PUBLIC repos (issue body, PR body, comments, review text) must pass sanitize HARD STOP first

## Applicability

This skill applies automatically when `git remote get-url origin` contains `github.com`. For non-GitHub remotes (GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.), this skill does not apply.

## Core Rules

### 1. Verification Plan Required

Every issue body and PR body must include a verification/test plan section. This is shared with code-workflow's plan step.

### 2. No Internal Paths in Issues/PRs

`.ralph/docs/`, `.ralph/fix_plan.md`, `.omc/` and other internal working paths must **never** appear in GitHub issue body, comments, or PR body. These are local-only artifacts.

**Instead of**: "See `.ralph/docs/generated/plan-180.md`"
**Write**: The actual content inline, or "See the implementation plan comment below"

### 3. Body vs Comment Selection

| Content Type | Target | Reason |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| Implementation plan (confirmed) | Issue body update | Stable reference for the issue |
| Checklist (impl/verify) | Issue body update | Trackable via GitHub checkbox |
| Discussion items / open questions | Issue comment | Threaded, time-stamped, doesn't clutter body |
| Progress updates | Issue comment | Chronological record |
| Review feedback summary | Issue comment | Preserves review history |
